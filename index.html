     	<th>&#8594; Ad Hoc Queries</th>
     	<th>&#8594; Geographic Visibility</th>
     	<th>&#8594; Ensure Quality</th>
     </table>
     <p>Profiles provides full transparency into supply chain and manufacturing metadata associated with all types of RFID transponders, setting a new standard in customer self-service. By providing both Web and Web Service access to supply chain metadata, customers are managing their RFID-enabled IP and technical data in a highly efficient manner.</p>
